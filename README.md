## Features

### 2D Dashboard:
- **Tachometer**: Displays engine RPM with a color-changing needle.
- **Kilometer Progress Bar**: Indicates distance traveled, resetting after 10 km.
- **Warning Indicators**: "Check Engine" and "Battery Problem" lights can be toggled with `C` and `B` keys.
- **Transmission Gear Indicator**: Circular indicator flashes based on current gear.
- **Graphic Display**: Moves a "blind mouse" symbol with WASD keys, which changes based on the car's gear.

### 3D Features:
- **3D Cabin**: Includes dashboard and external scene visible through the windshield.
- **Movement & Controls**: Car can move forward/backward and left/right with automatic transmission. Left-right movement is slower.
- **Street & Buildings**: Car moves along a street with buildings on both sides.
- **Lighting & Night Mode**: Includes Phong lighting model, directional light (mimicking the moon), and headlights with night vision.

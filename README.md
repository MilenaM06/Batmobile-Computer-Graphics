# Computer Graphics

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of the "Racunarska grafika" (Computer Graphics) course at Fakultet tehnickih nauka (Faculty of Technical Sciences).

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code and assets for the Betmobile 2D and 3D project, implemented using OpenGL. The primary learning resource for this project is LearnOpenGL, an excellent guide for learning OpenGL.

## Technology
OpenGL
OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API widely used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It provides a set of functions for handling rendering tasks, making it a powerful tool for creating interactive and visually appealing applications.

## LearnOpenGL
LearnOpenGL is an online resource that offers comprehensive tutorials and documentation for learning OpenGL from scratch. The tutorials cover a wide range of topics, including shaders, textures, lighting, and advanced rendering techniques. It serves as the main reference for understanding and implementing the graphical aspects of the Betmobile 2D and 3D project.
